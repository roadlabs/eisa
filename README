What Eisa Is
=================
Something like DLR/Parrot, on the web (...)

Written in JS (and also compiled into JS)

Still work in progress.

**DO NOT USE IN KEY PROJECTS UNTIL THIS LINE DISAPPEARED**

Maybe I should make it CommonJS-compatible...

Lofn?
-----------------
It is included in this project now. Ergo the original Lofn terminated.

About *.js.lsta
-----------------
This is the annotation script document for [[lstac]](http://github.com/infinte/lstac). To compile these documents:

 * (on windows) lstac <document> /out:doc/%d%n.html /template:doc/template.html
 * (**TBD**: other platforms)
